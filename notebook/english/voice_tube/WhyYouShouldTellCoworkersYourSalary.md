good going!

Asking for a raise is mean...

The right to show your salary is protected by the National Labor Relations Act.

Employees have the right to engage in... urgh, man this comic is boring.

So, without further ado...

Americans have an enormous taboo against talking about money.

It's the only way I enjoy fingers during intercourse.

Aww, fascinating.

they'll resent me!

I mean, they'll know that I'm filthy, stinky... middle class!

You dickhead.

Because it tilts paying negotiations in their favor.

It's a concept called information asymmetry.

it's easier for the company to rip you off.

Guess that's what everyone here makes.

And this perpetuates the pay gap.

The bottom line is, if you don't have all the information, you can get scammed, big time!


When you let these guys stop you from doing it, you push your own wages down

Which means you're spending more years of your life slaving away in a job that doesn't pay you what you're really worth.

Stop trying to lighten the mood with your fantastic boss humor.
