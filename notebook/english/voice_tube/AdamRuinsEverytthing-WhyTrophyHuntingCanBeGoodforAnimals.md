# Adam Ruins Everything - Why Trophy Hunting Can Be Good for Animals
Trophy hunting is barbaric.

I am against it.

You can tell by my tote bag.

This argument is really counterintuitive and, frankly,

trophy hunting can really help endangered animals.

Whoa! I'm an ostrich!

I am a frog man, and in Africa,

animals like these are in desperate straits.


Hey, no touching!

Ugh, I drink 50 gallons of water a day,
and I'm not as thirsty as this girl.

I'm a rich bro

who takes occasional hunting trips to Africa.

Meant to do that.

Judge this dweeb all you want,
but he's not why these animals are at risk of dying out.
The real threats are loss of habitat and poaching.

We're a criminal cartel
We cut off the horns and tusks
laughing maniacally

Poachers are organized, they're ruthless,
and they are decimating animal populations.

rhino horn is believed
to cure cancer and even hangovers,

Uck! That's awful!
 I got a family to feed.
In his defense, I do eat his livestock on the regs.

And just as harmful to animal populations

is the habitat loss caused by farming.

These animals are literally running out of places to live.

I would like to bazooka one rhinoceros, please. ...and used it to fund animal conservation.

Fine. There's an aggressive male who's too old to breed,

has attacked three people, and killed five other rhinos.

He's basically an ass(bleep).
Here's your receipt and your
"I'm a Rich Jerk Who Shoots Rhinos" tote bag.

What the hell? He's gonna kill a rhino.
Yeah, in Namibia, revenue from trophy hunting

is the main way they fund new wildlife conservancies

And in South Africa, a portion of the proceeds

to local land owners, and that incentivizes them

 protect them from poachers.
They're worth more alive than dead!

Breed, my little moneybags, breed.

 I understand that this is hard to believe.

I had a tough time with it, too.

the chair of the Sustainable Use and Livelihood Specialist Group

 sometimes even conservation groups themselves.

these programs can be a huge help for wildlife conservation.

100% of the hunting concession fees

Many countries are depending on this revenue to protect animals,

to pay the game guards, to buy the vehicles.

What happens if that money dries up?

Hunting is a really important source of conservation revenue,
Oh, man. Fun way to travel.

Hundreds of thousands being wiped out by poaching
and loss of habitat.

(ominous music)
(gasping and whimpering)
(shrieking)

I'm doing this for your own good.
