in the rhythm pattern of your language and I 
can't understand you
Everything we say can be drummed 
English is a beat-driven language
We speak in sound units. 
get rid of all of that
imitate everything 
when you feel you've mastered that go on to the next little phrase
imitate me, exaggerate it. Make the sounds big because you want to train the..the..organs 
You want to train the tongue, the cheeks, the lips, the 
whole mouth how to help you make these sound units. So exaggerate. Tongue twisters. 
She sells sea shells by the sea shore
It's more important that you have the up and down of the language than 

But mark my words, 
as soon as you start to practice these rhythms, you will begin to notice your accent is diminishing
