 * Testcase Example:  '[ ["a","b"],["b","c"] ]\n[2.0,3.0]\n[ ["a","c"],["b","c"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"] ]'
 *
 * 
 * Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where  A and B are variables
 * represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number).
 * Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return
 * -1.0.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Given  a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0. queries are:  a / c = ?,  b / a = ?, a / e
 * = ?,  a / a = ?, x / x = ? . return  [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
 * 
 * 
 * The input is:  vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>&
 * values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries , where equations.size() ==
 * values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations.
 * Return  vector<double>.
 * 
 * 
 * According to the example above:
 * equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
 * values = [2.0, 3.0],
 * queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"]
 * ]. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will
 * result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
