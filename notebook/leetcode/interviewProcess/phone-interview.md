# phone interview
The phone screen usually last between 30 and 60 minutes.

Your phone interview will cover data structures and algorithms. Be prepared to write around 20-30 lines of code in your strongest language. This should be clean, rich, robust code.

Your interviewer will ask one or two coding questions with lots of follow up questions. Be prepared to talk through your thought process while writing code in a `Google Doc` that youâ€™ll share with your interviewer. We recommend using a `hands-free headset` or `speakerphone` so you can type freely.

1.You will be asked an open ended question. Ask clarifying questions, devise requirements.
2.You will be asked to explain it in an algorithm.
3.Convert it to a workable code.
(Hint: Don't worry about getting it perfect because time is limited. Write what comes but then refine it later. Also make sure you consider `corner cases` and `edge cases`, production ready.)
4.Optimize the code, follow it with test cases and find any bugs.
