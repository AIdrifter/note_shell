# Google Hiring Committee
After the onsite interview, each of your interviewers (except the lunch interviewer) will have to submit detailed interview feedback. Each interviewer's feedback is kept hidden from other interviewers to ensure one's feedback does not influence the others. Each interviewer will assign a score and make a Hire / No Hire decision.

Assume the scores from the feedback are good enough, your whole packet will be moved forward to the hiring committee for review.

The hiring committee will review all submitted feedback thoroughly and make a hire / no hire recommendation. For more details about this process, you can read here.
